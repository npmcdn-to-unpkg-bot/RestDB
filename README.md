# RestDB
A proof of concept JSON database with a simple REST API  

Best way to run: Open in Eclipse and run "StartRestDBServer.java"  
Then point your browser to http://localhost:8080  

The server exposes a simple REST API to an even simpler virtual file system based JSON storage.  
It can store and retrieve JSON documents.  

The server also contains a simple HTTP file server to serve the example react.js demo app that uses the REST API.
