# RestDB
A simplistic JSON database with a simple REST API  

This is a **proof of concept** to show that it is possible to create modern web applications without a heavy application server.


Best way to run: Open in Eclipse and run "StartRestDBServer.java"  
Then point your browser to http://localhost:8080  

The server exposes a simple REST API to an even simpler virtual file system based JSON storage.  
It can store and retrieve JSON documents.  

The server also contains a simple HTTP file server to serve the example react.js demo app that uses the REST API.
